# MCSKopt
Process simulation-based design space optimizer with embeded Monte Carlo-based uncertainty quantification.


A MATLAB-based simulation-based optimizer implementing the framework developed for performing design space optimization under uncertainty in the following paper.

**Stochastic simulation-based superstructure optimization framework for process synthesis and design under uncertainty**


### Installing MCSKopt
Downloading and adding the folder path to your current MATLAB session will suffice to make use of the full functionality of the optimizer.
